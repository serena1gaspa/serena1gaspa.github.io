Created a free GitHub account.  
Forked the Jekyll blog template repository.  
Renamed the repository to `serena1gaspa.github.io` to enable GitHub Pages hosting.  
Customized the site by editing configuration files like `_config.yml` and content files such as `about.md`.  
Added my first blog post in the `_posts` folder.  
Committed and pushed all changes to GitHub.  
Visited my site at `https://serena1gaspa.github.io` to see it live!
